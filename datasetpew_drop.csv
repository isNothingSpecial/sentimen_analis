What's happening in Gaza it's not a war,it's genocide!lsrael

doesn't attack an army,they attacking an unarmed civilians,women,children.old people.Blow up homes with their residents inside the homes, they don't care if the homes have children,women,even people with special needs.those civilians need to be treated as humans, and that's their lowest right in this world. I am wondering how the world still sees the terrible actions from the terrorist Israel as oppressed?!! Children,"

13,13,"All ages are fun, but around 9-10 months it's a lot more fun cause he'll have his own personality. After a year it's great, he'll be waiting at the door and happy to see you, kinda like a dog, lol ... Glad to see the whole fam is happy!!"

23,23,"Are you gonna learn Björn swedish,english or japanese. Or maybe all"
24,24,"I just had my first son a couple weeks ago and I remember when I first found out I was pregnant, I was so terrified and Felix posted that him and Marzia were expecting and I felt so excited and comforted that my favorite YouTuber was expecting a child the same year as me. I've loved watching his videos and now having my own little boy in my arms and watching Bjorn with his parents has been such a cool experience! 🫶🏻"
25,25,This the best seeing my favourite youtuber being happy and have a child i cant express my feeling

28,28,question is japan safer than the us???
29,29,I'll admit it. I was secretly hoping they called Bjorn Bitch Lasagne instead. 😂
30,30,Mission accomplished 👏 congrats with the family.
31,31,Pewds with his son is portrait worthy next to Mona Lisa. Seems like they can telepathically communicate and it'd still be considered wholesome to some extent.
32,32,attractive video
33,33,Childhood time is the best my life
34,34,chinse cute baby

64,64,"i imagine when bjorn grows up, he's going to be a multilingual person. cause of just marzia being italian, pewdiepie being swedish, both speak english to converse with each other, and they're living in japan. Kinda cool honestly."
65,65,Wait till he turns two
66,66,your such a good father
67,67,"Damn, I'm kind of jealous of Marzia, to be honest. To be with a complex, tenacious and intelligent man like Felix; he'll do anything to make it work. I'm really bittersweet for them. Bjorn is in good hands. ☺"
68,68,Who is this guy? A swedish YouTuber settled in Japan nice
69,69,Does björn watch moomins?!

75,75,"6:22 Я работаюююю, меня зовут Бьёрн"
76,76,First 3 months are the worst after that u can sleep the whole night through
77,77,"I’m just so happy for him. It’s hard to be happy for someone when your in dark times, especially for a stranger but even tho I feel like I can’t better myself or I will never change or be better this video for some reason gives me a sense that true happiness is real and that all you got to do is reach for it."
78,78,"Deutschland dankt rechtherzlich für das ""Shoutout""!"

And tired hours of cranky baby. Just realize how crazy it is that you are papa Felix now. How beautiful. 🎉
152,152,"Grew up from like the age of seven watching him, I’m an adult now and watching him grow into a father is honestly the best thing. He’s grown with us and the content has as well."
153,153,"5:55 ""I'm going to 3D print you something"" is Felix's love language"

162,162,"I don't want to be a party pooper but the Babybjørn carrier is not ergonomically correct and can give baby pain in the hips, you can google this yourself if you don't believe me. I just bought Tula FTG as it is ergonomically correct for both baby and the person carrying the baby. I had babybjørn myself but stopped using it when someone told me it's not good for babys hips."

344,344,"Well Pewdiepie technically retired from seeing Youtube as his job. He has completed his dream life now with having a beautiful girl, living in Japan and also having a kid now. However he does upload now and then cause he likes making videos as a hobby."
345,345,"Is this wholesome era? Best era, fuck it"
346,346,Mr. Pewds focusing on his family is good for all of our mental health.
347,347,The bridge incident😊

Where is the Arab world!! Where is the foreign world?!! Scenes of children in Gaza 💔.. The children of Gaza were exterminated at the hands of the Zionist-Israeli occupation with American assistance, and the entire world is silent about the crimes of the occupation against the children of Gaza 😔😔.. This is the bank of the occupation’s goals in Gaza!! Where is the whole world that cannot see, hear, or speak!!


  


Где арабский мир!! Где зарубежный мир?!! Сцены с детьми в Газе 💔.. Дети Газы были истреблены руками сионистско-израильской оккупации при американской помощи, и весь мир молчит о преступлениях оккупации против детей Газы 😔😔.. Это банк целей оккупации в секторе Газа!! Где весь мир, который не видит, не слышит и не говорит!!"
357,357,PewDiePies sperm pet is so cute 😍
358,358,"I don't know if I'll ever have a kid, but if i do, i think I'd be crying the whole time. Just constantly overwhelmed with joy. They'd probably become the most spoiled brat I've ever known, and it'd be all my fault, lol.

For now, I'm single and hope one day I'll find my love. If i don't, I'll at least have my friends, and lots of books to read. I really hope i find someone to share my books with.

... Anybody interested in fantasy books?"
359,359,The audio that Marzia edits for the vlogs is always so interesting and soothing. The music complements the flow of the video clips in a way that really enhances the video as a whole. It’s nice to see editing done with such care and consideration for each aspect of it.
360,360,It feels like such a privilege getting to see Marzia and Felix fall in love with Bjorn and enjoying parenthood.
361,361,"""I'm 39 I can do dad jokes now"""

428,428,"Seeing the evolution of Felix’s life like this is astonishing. The way a stranger can be such a huge part of my life to impact me the way he always has, yet still be strangers is an insane concept. Not to mention how deeply I feel when seeing his love for Marzia blossom over the years, turn into the physical form of a mini human. I can’t get over him growing up so fast.."
429,429,Hard to believe finding you and watching you since grudge on Wii lead to this
430,430,This video cured my depression

573,573,"I love these vlogs! It's the aesthetic and vibe that Marzia's channel had, and I loved her vlogs so much. Bjorn is already growing so quickly. It's crazy to realize than when I become a lawyer, Bjorn will also be a toddler running around."

For you that you’re on this side of the two months"

637,637,Merhaba
638,638,Hi
639,639,These clips are special- and bittersweet. It reminds me of when we had our first boy. We went on so many little trips and spent a lot of time chilling together at home. Times are a lot harder now and it feels like we are always at work. Hopefully there are more good times on the way 🥲
640,640,Can’t wait to have better ear plugs ma GD ok etc
641,641,"Fixa rummet låten, från deras spel på barnkanalen i introt?"
642,642,Pewds is a badass dad for picking Bjorn as a name. Like what level of meditation did this man reach to make such a good name
643,643,Pewds NEEDS a dad mustache.
644,644,Who's that guy bro?
645,645,"Years ago I had a dream of Felix and Marzia having a baby. Seeing a video now of their child, is just incredible. Glad I was right😊 I wish this family the absolute best. So happy for you guys!!! ❤"
646,646,I'm so happy for him
647,647,Seeing this cute family be so happy in a pretty place warms my heart. Björn is so adorable and happy. His parents being there for his early development will help him in so many ways in the future.
648,648,I love this moment at 3:24 where he cant really say swear words so he as to say it silently because of the baby nearby.
649,649,He didn't like the train
650,650,Time went by so fast
651,651,He just so cute ❤❤❤❤
652,652,PewDiePie YouTube dad and baby daddy

657,657,How the baby works💀🙏😭
658,658,Now you have a kid to exploit. Don't kill it like all your pets you used.
659,659,"My second born is 5 weeks old, and it's so precious seeing these! The newborn phase is wonderful the 2nd time around, I think. You cherish it more knowing how quickly it goes by. My 2 and ½ year old still blows my mind. He used to be my tiny baby and now he's my itty bitty person ❤"
660,660,Nice
661,661,"what are you gonna do when björn needs to go to school, are you gonna send him to a japanese one or what?"
662,662,Keep him safe from the 🏳️‍🌈🙏💔
663,663,"With the chaos that's happening around the world, a PewDiePie video feels like a place to rest and take in a deep breath"
664,664,U guys!! Made me cry!!
665,665,"It’s so funny he brought up Ib, it unlocked some hidden away childhood memories for me. I remember watching that let’s play as a confused kid, not understanding what was going on at all. I went back to check and it  was 11 years ago!"
666,666,yeeet
667,667,"This is so cozy, this is like what you wanna watch after the main characters in the movie conquered all the conflicts and is now just chilling and having fun with the other characters."
668,668,"6:24 ""Я работаю! Меня зовут Бьёрн!"" this it so sweet omg"
669,669,"I've been a subscriber to pewds since the amnesia days, back in like 2011/2012, and it still feels a little surreal to see him as a dad now. It's heartwarming to witness :) I hope that Felix and Marzia and Bjorn have a wonderful autumn & stay warm for the upcoming winter months! Though I guess in Japan it won't get cold for a while! lol"
670,670,11:43 😂

686,686,Why do you always have 111M subs man
687,687,"Felix!! I might just be a paranoid greekswede trying to help out but make sure the little guy gets learned atleast one of the languages fluently. You live in japan where people speak japanese, you got italian in your household, you speak english and also of course our beloved svenska. I am afraid it will be difficult for him to learn one of them naturaly since he gets so many different influences. Greetings from Skane, Sweden."
688,688,I guess he's a family guy now.
689,689,👍👍👍👍

696,696,"Honestly, this is character development we seeing there."
697,697,"Imagine if the channel became an ""innocent"" family vlog channel."
698,698,Your now dad...
699,699,"watching this guy for years was a journey, seeing him become a dad, made me cry rn"
700,700,"1 Corinthians 15:1-4 NLT
Let me now remind you, dear brothers and sisters, of the Good News I preached to you before. You welcomed it then, and you still stand firm in it. It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you—unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place. I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said.

spread the word and tell people the gossable of jesus time is short the rapture is soon amen.  do not delete this post please."

858,858,congratulations on such a beautiful family 🙏🏼 grew up with both of you guys !
859,859,I catch up with you from time to time and I enjoy this content a lot. It is nice to see you (and Marzia) happy and Bjorn thriving.
860,860,"If you and Marzia are up for it, y’all should do a updated Q&A it’s been years!! I’ll start it off if you guys do decide. Marzia, how does it feel too see your love becoming a father? 💕"
861,861,Great video as always🥲Im happy for you guys that you are doing good 🥹It is also shocking how fast time flies away. I was watching his videos since i was 8 years old and now im 15 .
862,862,Haven't seen his videos in years. Great to see he's OK and getting into fatherhood. Stay safe!!
863,863,"Okay, now it makes me feel so old 🥺😭 im watching felix since i was in junior high maybe a 1decade ago. 🫣 congrats 🎉 Bro 👊"

868,868,The problem is that fun turns into frustration and sometimes lack of patience too 😂😂 trust me. If you have the luck of having a golden child then you better wear a helmet if a second is ever to come

1147,1147,That kid is gonna grow up healthy with all this attention from a mother and a father. Even being exposed to all sorts of different environments and stimulation like the beach. Some people don't have this privellage as the parents have to work long hours and have to hire someone else to look after them.

1425,1425,This baby is gonna have to learn 4 languages
1426,1426,日本に来てくれてありがとう！！これからも家族でのんびり過ごして下さい！
1427,1427,"You’re all so cute together, you and Bjorn walking through the garden with a butterfly flying around a flower, as well as Felix feeling cheer recalling a past game from long ago, was heartwarming 🥰"
1428,1428,"He's eyes so beautiful, <3. (I mean the baby)"
1429,1429,This warms my heart. I've been watching Felix for over 10 years. I can't believe he's a Dad now and Marzia is a mom. It's like I watched a big brother grow up. I'm so happy for you three and your beautiful family.
1430,1430,Im happy they're happy 😌❤️
1431,1431,"So nice to see you guys living your best life, sending much love from back in Brighton <3"
1432,1432,The kid looks more like Marzia.
1433,1433,I grew up watching Pewdiepie and it really makes me emotional to see him in this stage of his life. I started watching him as a kid and now I also have a kid of my own.
1434,1434,Your baby?
1435,1435,imagine how many languages can bjorn speak
1436,1436,You remember t series 😅😅😅😅
1437,1437,Being a long time fan it makes me happy knowing im going through the same stuff. My son is a year old now. You're going to be a great dad Felix. Im almost a year ahead and saying theres so much more fun to come is an understatement. I used to tune in for video games now its to remind me of how precious my family is.
1438,1438,the baby was for marketing use
1439,1439,"This is So wholesome, to see My childhood youtuber grown Up even more, it's amazing"

1444,1444,Ik Felix being a dad is crazy but… MARZIA DELIVERED A WHOLE ASS BABY😳🤩
1445,1445,"Dude it’s so crazy to see Pewds with a kid. Feels like everyone around me is growing up. My brother also recently had his first child. 
Life is strange. But also pretty good sometimes.

On a side note, 
This summer has indeed been extra hot. Even for weather in Texas. Hope y’all are surviving over there. Not sure what summers are like in Japan but I hear it can be pretty painful. Lol."
1446,1446,Imagine Bjorn playing amnesia when he’s grown up💀
1447,1447,I LOVE THIS SO MUCH HES LITERALLY A FAMILY MAN NOW 🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧
1448,1448,"Time passes very very quickly, when did PewDiePie become a full responsible grown man?"

1470,1470,Im starting to like this phase of pewdiepie
1471,1471,"When i was 15 i tried doing a flip on a trampoline and fell on my head, couldnt move for 5 min because of the pain, i thought i had broken my neck."
1472,1472,"Yes, the Japanese were very happy to accept Felix and Marzia with overwhelming joy -- because they are both married, and not interfering with the Japanese populace. Racism in Japan isn't verbal, it's very minute and subtly in your face."
1473,1473,Sometimes I believe in love and that maybe life is worth living
1474,1474,I feel old ❤
1475,1475,POV your a multimillionaire in the country you want to be in with the woman you love and a new baby. He really did it.

1496,1496,It’s a bit bittersweet that I became a pewds fan now that he’s “retired” but honestly the chill content is so refreshing. Sending lots of love to you and your growing family in Japan!!
1497,1497,Pewdiepie is a racist
1498,1498,I think I actually saw the day where Felix actually retired and had a family is crazy I’m just so wildly happy for them❤

1518,1518,I always said Pewds and Maria would make the cutest babies in the world and I was right. ❤
1519,1519,"Snälla Pewdiepie…. Ikke bli en baby vlogger. Skydda ditt barn. Du velger dette for barnet ditt. Det er et for stort valg for et menneske å ta for et annet menneske. Det er barnets ditt sitt valg å ta når han blir eldre å skulle bli en offentlig person. Jeg synes ikke det er din rett. Det er min mening. Tenk nøye igjennom dette. Du er så kjent, det har stor innvirkning på hans liv å bli kjent ufrivillig."
1520,1520,Enjoy it the years will go by quick and he will grow up quick today a baby tomorrow going to collage and leaving the house it's crazy how fast life passes us by. He is a beautiful boy wish you all the best of luck!
1521,1521,I feel like these videos are an incredible way to record memories for Bjorn

1541,1541,Bjørn is gonna be so smart growing up hearing/ speaking 4 languages from a baby
1542,1542,He sounds like he's reviewing a game when he talks about how his kid is doing lol
1543,1543,Kids arent content......he isnt even old enough to consent to being filmed to millions of people. Most of which have bad intentions
1544,1544,bro literally called someone the n word on twitch then ran away to japan. what a coward.

1557,1557,"I’ve been watching you since the beginnings of Friday with pewdiepie. I was always a different kid had some issues with my parents kinda fell into a deep depression since 5th grade - age 21 a lot happened between those details. I’m 24 now, I feel like I grew up with you bc you were my everyday watch. I live in NH USA. Watching you was definitely a life exploring experience. I had a lot of very emotional nights but idk your videos of you screaming super loud and laughing always made me happy. My dad overdosed in April 15th 2018 and stopped watching all YouTube. I just spread his ashes 2 days ago. Than this video popped up saying posted 22 min ago. It made me feel very proud of your accomplishments and mine yours at a higher social status but mine at a level I didn’t think I’d live to see. W ate to wish you and your family a long life and great happenings. As always my dude Bro Fist."

1590,1590,"Bjorn is gonna be at least quad-lingual with Swedish, Italian, English, and Japanese"
1591,1591,Another reason why abortion is bad and letting babies live is good. Very good.
1592,1592,"It is quite nice seeing the content changing based on how your life has changed, Felix. If you focus on different things, it makes sense for the material to change. And we continue to follow you and your family because you are a personable guy. The same cannot be said for a number of other content creators that rely on outrage or shilling. There is a limit to what outrage and shilling can provide in the long-term. As it is, wholesome life stuff is good for the soul of both the content creator and the people watching it."
1593,1593,he is too cute. he's such a smiley baby 🥺
1594,1594,It was Pewds who introduced me to Ib along with Mad Father and the other 2D pixel art indie horror games  that made me take interest in them. So thank you PewDiePie
1595,1595,I love these!!
1596,1596,"I feel uncomfortable  seeing this, Felix is now broadcasting his child's life without consent, monetizing his sons memories on YouTube, this is not right, if this person wants to be a important figure as an adult like a president or an important figure like that it won't be possible for him. This should not be allowed, a child's integrity should be respected. Good bye Pewds"
1597,1597,You two constructed that lil baby quite nicely if i do say so myself
1598,1598,Head south
1599,1599,Bjorn loves his dad so much! Such a cute and smiley baby
1600,1600,"Felix is explaining Bjorns stages like the game got a sick update 😂 “ya like a simulator, but shits way more interactive after launch”"
1601,1601,"we've come a long way bois, from seeing a swedish boy meeting an italian girl to them starting a family together. Its enough to make a grown man cry🥲"
1602,1602,"Pewds, living it."
1603,1603,"Felix should talk to Joe Biden , then he could say he has talked to someone who has said thuh ."
1604,1604,Make sure not to call him a n-word because your not o. A bridge
1605,1605,He’s already growing quite fast.
1606,1606,seeing pewdiepie talk about Ib in 2023 makes me so happy
1607,1607,How the baby works😂
1608,1608,This made me actually cry of joy this is just soo cute
1609,1609,"First time parent here, NEWBORN STAGE SUCKS. My kid is 2.9 years old and it's so fun now that he can communicate and even joke. I've been pranked so many times"

1631,1631,Will we be more hyped for Bjorn's first word or Bjorn's first bro fist?
1632,1632,Супер респек
1633,1633,It does my heart so good to watch someone else realize the joys of fatherhood. There's nothing better in the world than growing as a family with your wife. <3
1634,1634,"felix and family.. don't stop youtube, stay for us❣"
1635,1635,Can't believe this man screamed Stephano and other nonsence years ago now he is a dad...I hope Bjorn sees your early videos you practicly already raised millions of 9-12 years olds of different generations XD Felix and Marzia were really my childhood
1636,1636,"I just realize that 10 years past,wow"
1637,1637,"Anyone watching this thinking, how empty and meaningless their life is.
It fills me with great warmth and joy watching these last pewds videos, I feel like I took part in that life and I enjoy it with every single bit of my soul."
1638,1638,"Hey, we do not know each other but I would like to tell u that despite all the bad that you have done in your life, GOD still loves you and wants you to be with him (GOD), all yoi must do is to trust in Jesus like how he would trust in parachute when jumping out of a plane and you must be willing to turn from your wrong doings and do what is good😊😊 0:08"
1639,1639,It’s so weird they advise you not to go outside! I get not going anywhere crowded because of the immune system but just for walks for fresh air and for them to see the sun to get on a good circadian rhythm is so important. Isn’t that a huge thing in Sweden too? People just leave their babies outside lol
1640,1640,Pewdipie looks like such a dad now
1641,1641,we love you Björn
1642,1642,"My man enjoying his life to the fullest after being a gamer, its like seeing someone fought in a war for years and earned peace"
1643,1643,"I remember that one of the first videos I watched from pewdiepie was the Ib Playtrough, great to know he still remembers"
1644,1644,"He loves his son so much, it's heartwarming"
1645,1645,"The amount of happiness i get  from ur videos is amazing, editing on point, it's the best chill vibe ever and i'm amazed how loving father Pewds is and their life seems like it was worth all the hardships they have gone through. Nothing but the best for the whole family! <3"

1921,1921,"Please stop showing kids on the internet. It's great they're growing up healthy and all, but people nowadays really underestimate the dangers, bad people and the responsibility we all have for children. Please let them grow up first until they can decide themselves if they want their life to be public for the entire world."
1922,1922,"Watch Bjorn know Italian, Swedish, English and Japanese by the age of then. He is gonna be smarter than all of us"
1923,1923,He’s precious
1924,1924,This is adorable. Watching a man develop a family living his dreams is great. Bjorn is really cute. It’s going to be amazing to see how things change over the years.
1925,1925,“Some day this will all be yours Bjorn” 😂👏
1926,1926,Omg the ib lets play! it's been so long!
1927,1927,having known this man for so long i can genuinely see hes happy with his life now and bjorn is lucky to have parents like them :)
1928,1928,This is the definition of enjoy things while you can

1949,1949,"Can I just take a shot in the dark before it’s too late. MYYYYY personal guess is that bjorn mainly looks like Felix when he gets older,  but with marzias cute features, like her cute nose and cheek bones. IM LOCKING IT IT. 60-80% pewds and the rest marzia.
Sorry marzia. I know moms hate this (especially with their first)🤣🤣"

1958,1958,"The smile these vlogs put on my face and the warmth it brings to my heart is something I can't seem to find anywhere else in my life.

1970,1970,Ib is in my top 3 favorite let's plays you've done and I became obsessed with it after watching you play it. That game has a special place in my heart and the moment it popped up on that screen and you mentioned it just made all the nostalgia and happy memories come back. It's amazing to see how far you've come and really cool to see it kind of come full circle. Proud of you pewds

1978,1978,"Bro idk why I missed you. It’s been a while, I’m at a different stage in life right now. And looking at the thumbnail I guess you are too. We grew tf up man. I wasn’t even that big a fan of yours but there was a moment in time when I’d keep up with your videos. Because you resembled someone who’s character & qualities I like. You are a genuine person, with a kind heart and noble intentions. You also were someone I watched in my own little time. This personal time of my where I am left with by myself. Cause it’s like almost every activity I’m involved in, involves some other person in my life. But at this time when it’s not involving any other person in my life, it would be your videos I’d find solitude in. Now my solitude is in other things & I’ve grown up & so have you. I don’t have an older brother & that’s why I have a few. You are one of them man. It’s feels like so much I don’t even know what but it’s a feeling that is making my heart very heavy. & that’s partially because of where I am & now that I’m about to watch your video, realizing where you are & I’m just so happy that you are in a good place happy with Marzia & now another member of the family. I’m just so happy man, in a chaotic world to have some symbol of peace in you guys. Thank you bro 👊🏽"

It's been very nice watching your journey as a dad so far. Just the way you transition, film, and add music really transports me to a cozy state of being. It feels like a nice hug, the perfect view of the sun as it sets, or a lovely summer evening breeze. 
I kind of grew out of your videos the last few years but I'm glad they found me again. 

Sincerely, 
A college student stuck in the Midwest"

2116,2116,Bjorn was born a week before mine 👶 it's so wild to go through the same newborn stages from someone I've been watching for years. When they start smiling two months in it's so rewarding 😊😭

2799,2799,The way Pewds looks at Bjorn at the end 🥹🥹🥹
2800,2800,"Are they going to raise bjorn speaking 4 languages - Swedish, Italian, Japanese and English? Or would that be confusing"

Edit: Damn autocorrect"
2903,2903,"For those interested in learning more about Japan, I translate 1000+ year old Japanese stories and retell them in my own words on my channel. It's a way to learn about the history an culture of Japan while also getting at least some kind of entertainment. Maybe our boy here wouldn't mind learning about the stories of dashing Japanese Casanova's and superhumanly strong men and women, and mysterious Buddhist magic and the like. Take a gander. Throw it on in the background while you do something else more important. I can't promise it'll be the most entertaining thing you've seen, but it might leave you mildly amused, and somewhat educated."
2904,2904,SO CUUUUTE

3010,3010,Early
3011,3011,Bijorn is so cute ☺!!!!!
3012,3012,It is beautiful to see this content because it gives the perspective of a dad and i think everybody is super used to see mom's view.

3024,3024,"Ib recently got an increase in popularity, especially in Japan, because it got rereleased by a publishing company named Playism. It really is nostalgic seeing it all around again, since Pewdiepie's let's play was my first exposure to the game."
3025,3025,Best evolution on youtube
3026,3026,I wasn't ready to hear some russian words from italian/swedish family living in Japan 😅
3027,3027,Felix talking about Ib after all these years has done something to my soul
3028,3028,Cool. I want 5 more please
3029,3029,"Mah boi is 3 months and 25 days and when he’s not screaming, he’s all smiles and sleep. The first 3 months were more like 🙃 his belly was the issue. Now you would think it’s done, but baby is like ‚psyche!‘ now come the teeth. I love him. 
Enjoy the first year. When they can talk they start to remind you, that you promised gummy bears the day before and then you have to be consistent and have them after breakfast 😂"
3030,3030,"I loved this video, it’s great to see how good life can be and it gives me hope for the future. On another note, I remember the Ib playthrough and was so sad you never finished it! I always wondered why but I guess it wasn’t popular enough"
3031,3031,That Russian was cool btw
3032,3032,Felix need a book review pls ...

3037,3037,He’s adorable!
3038,3038,"It's crazy, huh. I grew up watching him as 13 year old. I remember when he used to fool around a lot and was so loud and it was so awesome and funny. I'm 22 now. And his content matured with him. He's a dad now. I'm truly happy for him and I'm always rooting for him. Coz it's like watching an elder brother growing up and maturing. You're still the best Youtuber in my eyes, Felix. Thank you for getting us all through some tough times."
3039,3039,Im proud of you felix🥹
3040,3040,"I can sincerely imagine Bjorn taking over the channel when he's older, like he'll be a 16yr old japanese vlogger that's into cinema and movie-making because of his dad"
3041,3041,"I'm curious, what language he will use, Sweden, Italian, English or Japanese?"
3042,3042,Меня зовут Бьорн was very cute

3203,3203,*Whoever reading this. Don't give up. Hustle everyday.*
3204,3204,0:27 of course she took the funeral 😂
3205,3205,"When people say ""Newborn stage is the best"", they mean the time before they can crawl, where they're light and weak, they smell nice, and their poo is clean, they spend half the day sleeping, you get all the cuddles, and everything is simple (bottle, bottom, bed). You don't have to baby proof anything, they aren't constantly running away, they don't fight you when you hold them, or flail around wildly head butting you and any other hard object they're close to... Newbor stage is best 😅"
3206,3206,felix just made a review out of bjorn
3207,3207,Bro you literally won the game
3208,3208,"i love these vlogs so much, they're so cozy to watch at night"

3213,3213,"Since Felix looks exactly like his dad, I wonder if Bjorn is gonna look exactly like Felix."
3214,3214,Pewds analyzing paranting in video game terms. First 2 months is tutorial mode then you get the interactive baby time after.  😄
3215,3215,"Such a beautiful family. Your happiness is so special, and Marzia looks like the best mother. I'm glad you continue to enjoy things and get out of the house and involve Björn"
3216,3216,Pewds finally after so many years learned how to do a KULLARBITTA!
3217,3217,wishing good health for Pewdiepie and his family
3218,3218,The baby is extremely cute but the skating scene made me feel that PewDiePie is gay now
3219,3219,"“Someday this will all be yours Björn”
- what is Felix plotting?"
3220,3220,"So wholesome. Wow. Really awesome to see this part of your life, Felix!"
3221,3221,Sometimes I wish I was this happy.

3224,3224,"I just realized this kid might have to speak 4 languages growing up
Marzia is Italian

They are living in Japan so Japanese

3245,3245,"MY HEART~

He was/is a major part of my childhood im happy for him"
3250,3250,"Bjorn is such a beautiful wee baby. 
I bet you can’t remember how you spent your days before he came 🤗💕
Are you going to bring Bjorn up being multilingual?
It would be amazing if he could speak Swedish, Italian, English and Japanese  🤗💕"
3251,3251,"I think a big part of us, if not all, will agree that at this point Pewds is like this long distance friend we spent our time with on the internet and we watched him grow and get this amazing life he deserves. Love you Pewds, for being their throughout my choldhood. Many blessings and good wishes to you and Marzia!! <3"
3252,3252,Dam he gave his son a cool ass name
3253,3253,Irrelevant
3254,3254,I pray for his safety
3255,3255,"*Can't wait for Bjorn's first Amnesia playthrough. I bet he will cringe over this silly retro game but we, old farts, would be excited af and give him in return tons of love and billion of views.*"

3263,3263,Japan is such a beautiful nation... I have never been there but I hope to someday. As for you Felix I am glad youve found a happy life after the rollercoaster of a journey you have been through. 👊🏼

3265,3265,This sounds so weird to say but i feel like felix looks more happier these days
3266,3266,"Damn, I remember Ib! Can't believe that was such a long time ago, I discovered it through your videos. Really cool to see that it's getting recognition even today. I'd love to see people revisit more RPG maker horror games."
3267,3267,Man i remember when your gameplay of Ib came out. 😭My sibliings and i would replay it as often as we can cause we were upset we couldn't play it ourselves
3268,3268,Hey don't forget to HEAD SOUTH.

3274,3274,"6:22 ""Я работаю! Меня зовут Бьорн."""
3275,3275,"Something in me melted when you excitedly recognised IB, I remember that being one of my first few lets plays I watched from you. It made me so happy :’)"
3276,3276,"These vlogs literally make my day better, also Björn is so cute smiling at the end, it melted my heart ❤"

3281,3281,pewds vlogs are therapeutic and it definitely will hit different if you’ve been a fan of his for a very long time. What a journey
3282,3282,"I'm not gonna watch this .... good luck to you pewds marcia and bjorn, but I feel bad watching this ..."
3283,3283,Baby Review
3284,3284,Jag tror att jag är den ändå som kollar på pwedipew från Sverge p
3285,3285,My first YouTube creator that I watched…now a father. Congratulations my friend. ❤
3286,3286,"I don't know why but this vlog in particular made me really happy. 
I'm glad I got to see glimpses of Marzia, I have been missing her makeup tutorials and her cute quirky style, and she looks so happy and content. 
Thank you for sharing us these glimpses of your lives, its the simple things that give me joy in life."
3287,3287,@3:29 how're you liking Love After Divorce?
3288,3288,I associate this song so much with Technoblade 6:08 it made me so happy to hear it. Techno and Pewds are two of the most influential people in my life. I'm happy Felix is out there winning in the game of life for us all <3
3289,3289,Poopy boy *😄*
3290,3290,"mannn this shit is so beautiful bro got a happy and healthy family in japan, what more could one want"
3291,3291,"I remember watching you play Ib, you were a huge part of my depressed teenager life. Turning 25 soon, and much happier, I'm so pleased to see you are happy too. Thank you, Pewdiepie"
3292,3292,Congratulations cute baby💖❤️ I love your videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
3293,3293,"Every time these vlogs go out, I always stop doing everything else. Really appreciate the vlogs Felix, I visited japan this may because of your inspiration and it was the best experience ever. So thank you for that. <3"
3294,3294,Björn is gonna live the life
3295,3295,"Marzia looks amazing, I hope she is doing well and yourself as well."
3296,3296,He kisses the dog more than the baby 😂
3297,3297,These new pictures of your family should definitely put you above 111
3298,3298,why is this video so chill
3299,3299,"Not really sure how to even describe how it’s felt watching Felix the last couple of years. Obviously we don’t know each other, but growing up and going through my own life experiences and watching Felix go through his at the same time, it very much feels like cheering on a distant friend as he lives his dream."
3300,3300,why he put the title like he reviewing an amazon package or sum
3301,3301,These vlogs really feels like a post credit scene and I love it <3. Considering the numerous controversies and days of Felix pumping out content everyday. It really is wholesome seeing him becoming a great parent and just enjoy life everyday.
3302,3302,"Damn, he’s so so cute I’m 53 I raised three kids by myself. You have something very special don’t ever let it go."
3303,3303,Omg the mention of Ib took me BAACK like I remember Ib and Mad Father so well fr !!
3304,3304,I'm actually curious. What language is Bjorn gonna end up learning. He haves like 4 options at this point 😅. I'm gonna assume English because it's the most common language. Then maybe Bjorn picks up on Japanese later as he grows up around the people of Japan.
3305,3305,From being a 13 year old kid  watching you play horror games to being a 26 year old with a family of my own its been one hell of a journey to grow alongside you and to see how far you've come is so awesome 😎 So happy for you both and baby Björn 🎉
3306,3306,Bjorn is so cute and precious ❤
3307,3307,when he is 13 watching his dad's videos he will feel embarrassed.
3308,3308,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
3309,3309,BASED
3310,3310,"Ive never seen a man enjoy his life more than Felix. Just jumping around like a child on a trampoline and then switches on to being the proudest, responsible father he is.😂😂😂😂"
3311,3311,"i started watching Pewds back in 2011, seeing him and Marzia become a happy family with a child is amazing."
3312,3312,13:41 i dont know why but that cute interaction
3313,3313,Newborn stage was always easy with my kids for some reason. Now my youngest is 1yr and she is a climbing maniac and can't let me sit down in my own home 😂
3314,3314,Imagine pewds making a video and see Bjorn running around 😂
3315,3315,Bjorn's gummy smile is the cutest ❤
3316,3316,In which language are they talking to him? 😅 Bjorn will be multilingual kid by birth🤩
3317,3317,Bjorn is literally so cute.

3328,3328,OMG i love. you! i watched you ever since i was 11. now im 18 with a boyfriend i wanna marry and i cant wait to live this with him
3329,3329,"Felix, hear me out get Bjorn his own Gundam stroller if they make one."
3330,3330,"I cannot express in words the amount of joy this video brings me, I'm excited to watch little Björn grow up."
3331,3331,the best thing about this is that bjorn can look back at this!

3356,3356,"I wonder what languages Bjorn will learn.. Italian, Swedish, English and  Japanese?"
3357,3357,"I’m so happy Felix and his wife are so happy together after all this time, along with being a happy pair of parents is beyond heartwarming. 😭❤️

I pray this family gets saved by God so badly, in the name of Jesus Christ I pray, amen. 🙏🏻"

3363,3363,This vlog was so cute omg
3364,3364,"Björn is adorable and I'm happy for you guys ❤ I have a 15 month old son, the newborn phase IS the hardest. Lots of people told me it would be the best easiest. Just brwathing and staying alive while.sleep deprived is for me the worst, even though it's less work to take care of the little ones."
3365,3365,"I never heard anyone use ""..."" in a sentence. My man, aren't you Swedish?"
3366,3366,Just heard about possible tsunami in japan. Hope you all stay safe

3379,3379,bjorn is the cutest little chunk EVER🥺
3380,3380,Can’t believe been watching you since I was in junior high
3381,3381,"Pew's is Swedish, Marzia is Italian. They live in Japan ... makes me wonder what Bjorn's native tongue will be. We all think in the language we first learn; just curious. I know for sure this kid will be well educated and literate. :) My guess, is English. Probably serve him the best overall."
3382,3382,Hey Pewdiepie random thought but are you at all worried about bullying happening through school raising your baby in japan? it is a very nice country but I hear schooling can be rough at times.
3383,3383,He starting  family
3384,3384,NICE
3385,3385,"These vlogs always feel too wholesome to handle, i end up tearing up a bit out of the happiness and satisfaction of his life being so perfect right now. Pewds, Marzia and bjorn, you deserve the best <3"
3386,3386,I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BRIDGE PEWDIEPIE
3387,3387,"Realizing what a brilliant boy Bjorn is going to be. Multilingual kid!

3388,3388,Here before pewdipie get famous!
3389,3389,Felix is really starting to look like a dad❤
3390,3390,I can’t believe he remembered Ib

3396,3396,4:43. So wholesome.
3397,3397,I love watching babies grow ❤ It looks like Bjorn is growing out of his stinky noisy houseplant stage 😢 He’s so much more aware and present 😂
3398,3398,Man’s living his best life and so is Marzia and so is Bjorn and so is Edgar and so is Momo. And Maya and Slippy had their best lives too.
3399,3399,Thaf is a the cutest fucking little YouTube strawberry prince I have ever seen ❤
3400,3400,I’m sooo happy for them ♥️♥️ I finally get why people watch family channels felix vlogs are mind changing 🤣
3401,3401,"The Ib memories takes me back, hella spooky game. Wild how time flies"
3402,3402,I love him! ❤️ 🥰
3403,3403,"I have to be sentimental for a moment: I have great memories of watching Pewdiepie when I was a kid. It left a lasting impression. Felix gave me a friend in middle school while I was bullied and had none. I eventually made new friends because we had this in common. We'd watch his videos every day, play the same games, and pretend to be YouTubers ourselves. It influenced my sense of humor,  inspired my love for video games, and kindled the spark that lead me to pursue a career in Game Design and Creative Technology over a decade later. I'm a completely different person than I was. I graduated high school since then, went to university, took an extra year, and am set to graduate in May!

So much has happened since then: Pewdiepie fans have come and gone, grown and changed, new fans are introduced every day- and here we are: all ages and lifestyles, millions of people from all over the world united by this content. Pewdiepie is a dad now: there is a an entirely new person in this world that wasn't here before, a new generation to foster with endless possibilities. As much as I am a random stranger on the internet, I am so very proud of all the ups and downs that have lead each and every one of us to where we are now! 

I wish nothing but peace, health, and happiness for this beautiful family (and to everyone reading this) in the decades to come. Thank you from the bottom of my heart ❤"

3408,3408,"1:56 🚑🚑🚑😊❤ 🚃🚃🚃😫💔
Love that you’re reading him Japanese picture books. He’ll be growing up speaking four languages😮Maybe not so surprising in Europe but I’m in awe!!!"
3409,3409,Feel like his first stuffed animal should be a Maya so he could still know somewhat about her
3410,3410,Pewds is starting to look more and more like his dad
3411,3411,My man has come so far
3412,3412,omg Ib mentioned

3414,3414,He babbles soooo much he’s so CUTE 🥹
3415,3415,"chocolate covered potato chips are a thing

babies are supposed to thrive on face to face stuff - toys don't usually excite their brains on research studies - they're not supposed to get too much sun"
3416,3416,Ragnar and bijron ironside
3417,3417,We gon be watching bits of this precious kiddo growing up bois. Must protec.
3418,3418,That baby is gonna know so many languages
3419,3419,I just have one request. Do not turn him into Ryan's world.  Let him enjoy being a child etc.
3420,3420,"Im so happy about Pewds! Beautiful family, wish you all the best"
3421,3421,"So I guess it’s safe to assume, that by the age of 5 Bjorn is going to speak fluently in 4 different languages."
3422,3422,royce chocolate crisp are so good
3423,3423,Bjorn seems like such a happy baby 💜
3424,3424,what language is Bjorn gonna speak as his first tho?
3425,3425,Bro just made my year with this one
3426,3426,These dogs brighten my day up every time 🥺

3428,3428,I was really young when Im watching this guy…now he has a kid
3429,3429,"Bjorn is going to know all the languages. Swedish dad, Italian mom, both speak English, but you live in Japan 😂"
3430,3430,He sold his kid for fame...
3431,3431,❤❤❤
3432,3432,GPS interrupting pewds vid  HAHAHA 🤣
3433,3433,"NGL, I was grinning ear-to-ear like an idiot watching Pewds interacting with baby Bjorn.  What a strange journey it's been.  Incredibly wholesome content."
3434,3434,He is real life Gojo satoru .with blue eyes
3435,3435,I can't wait for ken and Felix to make a video so he can ask Ken all the Dad questions 😂😂
3436,3436,"This vide is really beautiful. I feel like this is what peak human experience is like. You're truly blessed, and the best part is that you deserve all of it. You inspire me to work hard to achieve happiness. Peace and love to you and your family pewds, thanks for everything 👊"
3437,3437,I just realised that bjorn will be like 78 in 2100 and in my head i was always like 2100 is like farrrrrr into the future and i wont be alive then but for him its not that far idk if this makes sense
3438,3438,I fear the inevitable day bjorn sees the bride incident
3439,3439,bjorn is such a cutie when he smiles🥺 he already grew up so much
3440,3440,"I feel a disconnect from entertainers i watch, but for Felix ever since he retired i started caring for his wellbeing and seeing him be so happy brings me joy. 
I don't feel like we're friends but i find myself cheering and wishing well for him and his family."
3441,3441,"I just realized Bjorn has the chance to speak 4 languages Italian, Swedish, Japanese, English my boy gonna be OP AF what a head start"
3442,3442,I just randomly had pewdiepie on my recommended and I haven’t watched him in a long time so when I found out he had a baby just now I was like :00
3443,3443,If you can teach him Swedish. I wish my father had taught me his mother tongue.
3444,3444,These videos make me so happy.
3445,3445,"sometimes i forget babies grow and soon they’ll be running around. when my nephew just started to walk, he was so scared to fall and would ask to be carried"
3446,3446,If Bjorn runs for president he can enact all of Felix’s promises 😂
3447,3447,Felix you are becoming to look more and more like your father. Its so wholesome because you are father now too.
3448,3448,Marzia editing style is always top noch 👍

3513,3513,"Amazing video, and Bjorn looking soo good 😝"
3514,3514,Thank you for sharing your life with us. You don’t have to do that but you do.
3515,3515,"Little does pewds know ,what Bjorn was trying to say in his baby talk is “hows it going bros”"
3516,3516,有名人が顔出して歩けるのは、やはり日本はいい国だな😊
3517,3517,This new let’s play is great. Awesome review at the end
3518,3518,"What a happy family
😊 

The sleepless nights will be worth it"
3519,3519,I can tell you’re fully committed to your wife and child and that makes me happy.
3520,3520,Breeder propaganda 🤮
3521,3521,lil bros gonna have to learn 4 languages
3522,3522,"Felix speaking Russian threw me of guard so much,  good accent !"
3523,3523,"Looking at pewd content recently has been soooo uplifting and wholesome and inspiring
more than ever
feels good"
3524,3524,I like the small glimpses we get to see of Marzia. I still miss her Youtube channel ❤
3525,3525,:D
3526,3526,"Hey, hope you're all well :). Out of curiosity will you teach Bjorn English, Swedish, Italian and Japanese? Sending love x"
3527,3527,I love the content. Papa Pewds is my favorite Pewds.
3528,3528,"*How’s it going Uncles*
*My name is Bjorn*
7:55"
3529,3529,I love your vlogs. But Bring back Wizard Lizard and Lydia.
3530,3530,Soon we will have to become 9 year old from 19 year olds again
3531,3531,I am great full for Pewds allowing us to follow along on his journey through parenthood
3532,3532,4:20 Isshiki Beach is where the Imperial Family have their beach resort property. Someday you might come across our Emperor& Empress Emeritus on a stroll 😊
3533,3533,Buen trabajo pequeño Bjorn
3534,3534,Watching Pewd's vlogs now is just getting chills every 10 seconds.
3535,3535,🥲
3536,3536,Thank you for sharing such intimate moments. Enjoy every moment Felix
3537,3537,this is so sweet
3538,3538,So glad he's not feeding his baby dog food.
3539,3539,"я работаю, меня зовут Бьорн 🥰"
3540,3540,My optometrist says that you shouldn’t stand behind a baby or make it look up too much
3541,3541,❤❤
3542,3542,7:55 little guy legit looks like pewds in this. wow
3543,3543,"My mom heart melts over bjorn,,, so cute 😍"
3544,3544,"My word, half Viking and half Roman with the nationality of a Samurai?! A born warrior."
3545,3545,just wait til björn starts teething and gets to the terrible twos 😂😅
3546,3546,It’s known that wildebeests can walk within 10 minutes of being bjorn. Don’t let an animal outdo your son! Force him to start walking! Also play Beethoven to him at night so his brain will grow in size!
3547,3547,it's like watching a dailyvlog on Animal Crossing universe
3548,3548,Watching this really warms my heart. I just became a new father and I can tell you its been something. Sadly my son was born with a rare syndrome and he requires heart surgeries. He had his first heart surgery when he was just one month old and he got his second just yesterday. It’s been a very scary journey and a lot of emotions. But it’s a beautiful thing when you see someone happy and just seeing Felix with his son is the most beautiful thing ever.
3549,3549,Lovin this.
3550,3550,"I totally relate to the last part of the video! I feel like, especially for new mothers, everyone hypes of the newborn stage as this magical connection between mother and baby. But I like...just didn't have that at all lol and that's totally normal! Newborns don't really do anything besides blank stare at you, cry, poop, sleep and eat. Especially if it's your first kid too. There's just so many new things you're figuring out, it's hard to feel a strong connection to them right away. That 2month mark really is a huge turn around when they finally start cooing and smiling. It's like you can finally breathe a little bit too as you all start to understand each other more haha. Wait until the toddler stage when their personality really comes out! My girl just turned 2 and its a whole new world of fun and chaos. It's so awesome being a long time fan and somewhat going through these stages of life at the same time! All the love to you and you're beautiful family!!"
3551,3551,Watching this vlog while simultaneously watching his old gameplay videos is like watching two different YouTube channels. I couldn't be any more happy for PewDiePie's development. God bless him and his family.👼
3552,3552,Love the portrait mode clip very cool
3553,3553,Imagine being reincarnated as the most famous youtubers son😩
3554,3554,My jaw hurts cuz I will always smile whenever i see Bjorn ❤

3556,3556,Does Marzia edit these vlogs? Missing her vids ❤
3557,3557,stuck in 111m
3558,3558,Mine is 5 months now and wow they grow up so fast 🥲 It's a crazy journey but definitely the most fulfilling and beautiful for me. They will do such a good job. Biörn has such a loving home. ❤ I wish them all the best!
3559,3559,❤

3563,3563,"Had my first baby and son 1 month before Felix, Its fun to watch him come to the same realizations about little bubs"
3564,3564,Bjorn is so cute
3565,3565,両親の日本語が不完全となると、ビョルン君がもし日本の学校に通うとすると、両親に日本語を教えることになるのでしょうか😅
3566,3566,What a flashback! I remember watching your Ib playthrough. Really got me into indie horror games!
3567,3567,It’s crazy how I can still remember watching you play mad father when I was in elementary school and now you’re a dad😮
3568,3568,OMG the baby is sooo cutee.. God bless your family!! Soo wholesome 😊
3569,3569,You both are such loving parents It is so good to see you taking him out to experience all that you are seeing and doing. Babies thrive with visual stimulation as well as talking to them and singing. Thank you for taking us on this new journey with you.

Happy to see you and Marzia and Björn doing well! :3"

3848,3848,So is Bjorn Japanese???
3849,3849,"Happy to know you are a great dad!  Are you going to raise your son as a multilingual, including Japanese?  If so, Dad & Mom will have to learn Japanese harder.  I recommend you take some martial arts, for example, Karate, Judo, Kendo, Kyudo, Aikido, Iaido, etc.  You can absorb the Japanese language and culture much more through them.  Plus, your son will highly respect you soon. I hope you teach him gradually there are much more profound cultures because you chose Japan to live in, and it has special privileges. He is a fortunate one!  Blessing to you and your family."

Literally the perfect life
I'm sure it had its ups and downs and I bet living with Marzia wasn't always perfect since all humans are flawed but seriously...
Multimillionaire by playing games and making dumb videos (though I know some parts were stressful as fuck), retired buy still making money both from youtube, extra ads and investments, being able to enjoy ""tourist Japan"" forever, a beautiful wife and a healthy child...
I hope you at least take advantage of all this and have 2-3 children at least and not stop at one"

Obviously we don’t know each other, but growing up and going through my own life experiences and watching Felix go through his at the same time, it very much feels like cheering on a distant friend as he lives his dream."

4191,4191,"seeing the difference between you and mr beast is notable. It seems like as you got more popular, u became more real with your audience and grew with them. While, I can relate to mr. beast less and less as he goes from funny lighthearted  “your minecraft intros suck” to putting on this sterile, camera friendly personality"

4280,4280,what kind of content can rack up 111M subscribers!!??? Wow!!!
4281,4281,I wish I knew what it was like to be a father and be loved in that way. I am so broke I will never bring a child into this world. I dunno how to get out of it. Always almost being homeless. I dunno why I even push forward tbh. Im always sad when I see videos like this because I know the people in it are comfortable and happy. I dream every second of my life that I could just not care about money. Just be okay. I dont think I will ever know what that feels like. I am turning 33 in 3 days. I failed.
4282,4282,Bjorn is already smiling I can't 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

4446,4446,"A thousand times YES! Our boy is born june 10:th, so he's almost 4 months old and I agree! The first 2 months are definitely the hardest! It sooooo much fun when they get more interactive and they're not just a ""blob"" anymore. They smile, they play, and they start to take in their surroundings. They react to sounds, you playing with them and other stuff. It's so amazing to discover their little personalities."
4447,4447,W germana
4448,4448,Can't wait til bjorn is old enough to realize who his dad really is.
4449,4449,"One day Bjorn is going to look at this videos and say ""whoa mom and dad were so young here "" "

Frankly yes, he will make mistake. Yes, there will be good days and bad days but still never stop loving your kid.
But watching you for years on YouTube ever since I was a kid I’m in my 20s now I believe you will make a great father.
Again, congratulations,

4509,4509,This makes me so incredibly happy to see
4510,4510,The gps scared me
4511,4511,Domestic bliss seems pretty cool. I'm still 21 but being able to have something like that one day once I've gotten to a stable enough state where the small human and other animal(s) can grow up in a calm environment... that'd be nice
4512,4512,Ive just became a father myself and im so happy we came this far Felix! Keep up the good spirits and cherish all those moments. When they're so small you will honestly miss it hard.
4513,4513,Do pewds learm björn swedish?

Most people will never be able to achieve this level of success to make this way of life a possibility, including myself. But I watch these vlogs with allure because even if I may not get there myself, I'm glad that this good fortune came to someone who truly appreciates and deserves it. Live a great life Felix."

Newborn stage felt a bit like that for me too. Once the interactions go back and forth you can really start to discover one another!

4763,4763,"Newborns are so hard to get used to, my son’s currently three weeks. The first day home was so incredibly hard because you don’t know if you’re doing anything right. Right now it’s just pooping, eating, and sleeping. I’m glad you and marzia seem to be doing well, Björn is just so happy and chonky. It’s such a blessing having babies."

4777,4777,"""you're not supposed to bring a baby outdoors for the first 2 months"" im sure he's right but i can't help and think 10,000 years ago women used to give birth in the middle of the woods biting down on a stick. And the baby would just plop down onto an ant hill while a pack of angry wolves was gathered in the distance"
4778,4778,"all fun and tickling games, until he can reach things."
4779,4779,Little dude is gonna speak like 4 languages by the time he's 5.

4786,4786,"@Pewdiepie I just realize that Bjorn will be able to speak Japanese, Swedish, Italian and English at some point. Has blond hair and blue eyes, his dad is one of the most famous YouTubers in the entire planet. Man this kid will rizz everyone once he goes out in the world, kinda jealous tbh."

4788,4788,Stay well my boy. Just some wishes from your uncles
4789,4789,I just realised Bjorn has the potential to be speaking 4 languages by the time he is able to speak at all
4790,4790,❤❤❤

4793,4793,AS A LONG TIME VIEWER LOOKING TO HAVE KIDS PLEASE DO NOT MAKE BJORN CONTENT YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY THE INTERNET IS FELIX I GET ITS YOUR CHOICE BUT DONT DO SOMETHING YOULL REGRET. THINK BEFORE YOU POST KIDS ARE NOT CONTENT.

4822,4822,8:59 This is the ultimate Ib throwback. Unfathomable.
4823,4823,they should have named bjorn baldur because that kid will be able to go anywhere in the world and never be in any shred of danger. it pays to have 111m uncles and aunts lol

4911,4911,That Babushka expression was unexpected lol. What a beautiful family
4912,4912,Quick question Felix is a pescatarian would he let Bjorn choose to eat meat so he can gain more protein or he will let him follow their food diet 🧐

5135,5135,Bjorn is really starting to look like Felix
5136,5136,Not a fan of people having kids. Lost alot of respect for him. Humans need to die out and fast. Why make kids when the planet is maxed out ?? 😂 bringing new humans into this world is selfish.
5137,5137,"You playing mad father, ib and all those pixel horror games will always be my favorite videos of yours!!"
5138,5138,Hej hej Björn

5145,5145,Could you imagine being Björns babysitter? Pulling up to a babysitting job and it’s PewDiePie and Marzia. He’s going to be such a cool kid when he grows up.

5173,5173,It's still surprises me when he randomly starts speaking Russian.

5182,5182,"Bjorn is already a bookworm like his papa, so impressive that he finished The Enchiridion by Epictetus and has already started Meditations by Marcus Aurelius"
5183,5183,"Thanks pewds for sharing your wonderful family adventures ❤️

Bjorn is so adorable! ❤️ p.s. you may clean his tongue with a damp cloth to remove some milk residue. 😊"
5184,5184,Hawaii has been hot too! And around fall it usually starts getting colder but its been hella hot… :’0

5186,5186,Being an old pewdie fan and seeing where he is now is heartwarming
5187,5187,"I adore baby Bjorn content but I like that Felix and Marzia still find time to go out on dates just for the two of them. It’s hard to make time with a newborn especially, but it’s honestly so endearing seeing them still have fun and be in love with each other and shit"
5188,5188,Did Pewds get a Baby Bjorn for baby Bjorn yet?
5189,5189,That's one good lookin baby! I'm so happy for you guys!

5201,5201,I love that part when you can start to really to get to know them and their character. Another fav part is when they say or act out something with gestures and realize they are actually copying mom or dad lol. Mine 3yr old puts his hands on his hips.😂
5202,5202,I hope when Bjôrn gets 17 years old or something he will read this comment.
5203,5203,"I willl dieee of cuteness dude!! these videos make my day im so happy for your little family full of love🩷🩷 i keep thinking how beautiful these videos will be when björn grows up, seeing all the love his parents have for him, all the baby talks and smiles :))))"

5213,5213,That “head south” caught me off guard
5214,5214,"Famous last words:
""We're past the hardest part now."" 😁

Joking aside, I've got two myself. Now 10 & 7. Still gets harder now and again than ever before as a parent. But that feeling of getting more back increases more than the difficulties.

Simply said. It gets better. All the best wishes to you and yours from us."
5215,5215,imagin when bjørn gets older he needs to talk swedush english italian and japanese
5216,5216,wow

5218,5218,I am so so so grateful that you are sharing these sweet moments with us pewds! I feel so cosy watching these. I feel emotional. Also 9:01 IBB! How nostalgic.
5219,5219,I loved the game ib!
5220,5220,"The editing is so good on these and the way Marzia records some of the sections in these vlogs looks so high quality and warm. Love to see these vlogs , makes me feel super nostalgic ."
5221,5221,"I know you probably won't see this but if you're ever looking for places to get away, the man from the channel 'Aty' takes his otters camping & on day trips to some of the most beautiful places in the country and lots of the time shows where they are on a map.."
5222,5222,"Three of my favorite old-school YouTubers (Felix, Brad Jones, and Danny Gonzalez) becoming fathers this year is so heart-warming"
5223,5223,"When Bjorn is older, i hope he can look back at these vlogs of him and his parents with fond memories."
5224,5224,"It's still weird seeing Pewds with legs ngl , I don't see that often"
5225,5225,The last bit gave me the idea that you could do a BABY REVIEW!? Others or your own and see who can relate or what weird things babies do that others might not.
5226,5226,you guys are all so mature. when i watch these vlogs all i think is how miserable my life is😭
5227,5227,How will it be when he’s old enough and starts watching cocomelon
5228,5228,The amount of joy these vlogs give me!!🥹
5229,5229,Man I'm so happy for pewds ❤❤ God bless him and his family ❤❤

5242,5242,felix.. u make me want to have a family too 🥺
5243,5243,❤❤❤
5244,5244,"So sad he didn't get to go into that Ib exhibition. I'm sure they would have loved having him there and I'm sure they would have let him in if he just said ""I'm Pewdiepie"" even if it was sold out. But I guess he's not a fan of doing stuff like that. And you know the game devs are gonna see this video and feel bad that he couldn't get in."
5245,5245,Makes me want a wife and kid so bad
5246,5246,Björn looks like such a perfect baby. His face just looks exactly like a baby model lol he is very handsome ❤

5264,5264,Very wholesome. This is what the world needs more of. Just positive energy about everyday life.
5265,5265,"The newborn state is absolutely the worst, who was telling him that was the best part? The baby just eats, sleeps and cries every 2 hours and if you leave it alone for 5 minutes it might find some way to die."
5266,5266,"I feel like you definitely could have gotten into that exhibition by being like “hey I’m pewdiepie”, but I super respect you for not doing that"
5267,5267,Pewdiepie has a cutiepie!
5268,5268,"Wild for Björn, Italian mother, Swedish father, English speaking, but also in Japan xD"
5269,5269,So happy to see how much bjorn is taking care of pewds and marzia. Really wholesome

5271,5271,"if Bjorn starts learning Swedish, Italian, English and Japanese he is gonna be a quandrilingual... I mean English and Japanese are gonna be the must but it would be cool if he got interested for the other two once he is able.."
5272,5272,Thank you for sharing! That’s awesome!

5279,5279,"Bro if you think the 2 months stage is the best, just look forward for the next 2-3 years. Those are the best, hands down. It's going to get awesome."

5289,5289,Felicidades! I never heard of this guy before. I came here after reading From Dreams to Riches by C.K. Butler about the new AI thing people are using to make money online. It just came out on Amazon. It mentions a gamer and I was wondering who it was and I found out it's probably this guy. I already made money from an idea in this book. He is my inspiration!

5365,5365,"1:39 Okay, I'm far from even being bad at Japanese, but what does モトランポリン (motoranporin) even mean? As far as I know トランポリン (toranporin) means trampoline, so why the leading モ (mo) at the beginning? Is it a typo, or? I'm really curious! I'd be honored to find a valid error in regards of my knowledge in Japanese 😅"

Its always up and down but so much fun and love, i loved the first 3-4 years so much. There is a quote, if you have a child, you will get used to the fact, that you feel like your heart is not any longer inside you, but with the kid, always. ❤"
5392,5392,"when björn grows up he will know swedish,english and japanese but what will be the first?"

5420,5420,I cant wait till his kid reacts to the bridge video
5421,5421,Cool
5422,5422,"2 years old is, I found, the most comical years. 2-4 where they're picking up so much language but the way it comes out is so funny getting some words mixed up & their own interpretations. Also the time when they're most mischievous getting into everything and picking up speed. 
It was all a joy raising children. I loved it."
5423,5423,I love seeing this dude living his best life
5424,5424,he's growing too fast 😭😭😭😭😭🤍

5480,5480,W
5481,5481,I think it’s absolutely amazing that Felix is trying to teach his child multiple languages. It will set him up for success in the future
5482,5482,Mom and dad 😭💕
5483,5483,"Ib was what made sub to you eleven years ago it was sooo nostalgic to me seeing you talk about it! 
It´s crazy to me that Marzia doesn´t know it, it seems totally like her type of thing

Bjorn´s eyes are getting sooo much like yours Felix!! I loved this vlog I wish your family the best"
5484,5484,"From the funniest unhinged YouTuber to an amazing calm dad, you're a legend and truly an inspiration Pewds!"
5485,5485,God you can become the next movie maker
5486,5486,What time was he Bjorn?
5487,5487,"You, sir . . . you and your family give me hope.  Maybe that's sad, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that you just seem like such a kind, grateful and upbeat person and family.  I wish nothing but success and happiness for you and yours.  Blessings."
5488,5488,"I’m so glad you guys are doing well 
Bjorn is honestly so precious and he has two of the best parents a kid could have"

5490,5490,"This two has the most successful timeline in terms of dating, long term relationship, starting a business together, getting married, and now finally having a kid. I know they're not aiming to be anyone's role models but Felix and Marzia are what young couples nowadays can look up to. It takes a lot of work to be each other's equals and they didn't shy away from showing their audience that."
5491,5491,Bjorn è così carinooo. 🥰
5492,5492,Pewdipie is officially a family youtube channel lol

Now here we are seeing him all grown up with a kid.

Wonder what the kid will think when he realises his father is a famous youtuber when he grows up..."
5502,5502,HE IS YOUR COPY!!!!! So cute
5503,5503,My sister said the same thing. The newborn stage is not fun. There’s so much more fun when they get older.
5504,5504,"12:45 Pewdiepie describing the hit new game, having a child. Just look how fun and interactive that gameplay is!"

5578,5578,"The rate at which babies neurons are firing in their brains to figure out things are the equivalency of geniuses and scientists of our modern-day. It's kind of a moniker to say that babies are geniuses and scientists at the same time because everything they are doing they are conducting a scientific experiment and their little own baby brain at the same time firing off the same amount of neurons inside their brains they'll be the equivalency of a scientist trying to conduct a life-changing problem for the world. 

This is what spin-off series such as baby geniuses and things like Will Smith son saying that if everybody was a baby we would all be geniuses when he was like 14. 

Thank you for coming toy TED Tall."

5618,5618,Björn's gonna look back at this and hear his dad talk about his personality evolving.. He's gonna love this!
5619,5619,"I can definitely tell that having a baby has changed Felix in such a good way! Fatherhood looks so good on him. He already seems softer, calmer, and much happier...which is wild because he already seemed that way ever since moving to Japan, but it's almost like he moves different now that he has a child. I suppose that's what people mean when they say becoming a parent changes everything for them, it's interesting to see it happening in real time."
5620,5620,"I absolutely love seeing Bjorn and all the short shots, which mean you're focusing on each other and not the camera."
5621,5621,"I lost my baby around the time that marzia was pregnant too, but I'm still happy for them everything I see them with their new baby... I guess it's kind of a weird healing to see happy babies with happy parents^_^"

5722,5722,"Thats so crazy they had an Ib event!! What crazy timing. I've been replaying a lot of RPGMaker style games like The Witch's House and Mad Father the last week or so, and I've been wanting to replay Ib. Im saving it since it was my favorite. I found it through your lets plays actually, so again, super crazy that right when I get back into it, they have an event lol.

Bjorn seems like he's really starting to come into his personality, haha. He's so cute and sweet 😊 I'm so glad that you, Marzia, Bjorn, and the pugs all seem so happy. Wishing you all lots of joy in the future as well!!"

5724,5724,"last think i would thought is that Felix would become Family vlogger. As Swede with name Felix, i couldn't be more proud of my nephew Bjorn."
5725,5725,"The intro tells you just how serious Global Warming is and how its affecting the lives of the people. If we don't do anything now then by the time Bjorn reaches college, he will experience very difficult conditions to live in."
5726,5726,"9:30 Not even joking, i am a like og bro i've been watching pewds since like 2011. And i remember i loved IB so much the first time i watched him play it that even today i keep revisiting his series.

5936,5936,"PewDadPie 🐐

October 5, 2023"
5937,5937,Great content
5938,5938,"pewds its said that if you exercise your baby they are healthy and I AM SERIOUS it actually is, there are like some stretches and   massages that you can do to bjorn which will make him healthy. i am sure you can notice that babies nowadays are just obese and to fix that you shoud find something to about it.

just a advise by a 14 year old because my mom told me that i was super healthy as a baby firstly because of the genes and an old lady came regularly to massage me and stretch me.
just want bjorn to be healthy and not face any issues. please someone tell him, so his baby can get some gains.
hope he stays healthy and i hope i can meet him in the future when i am a adult and he is a teen"

6071,6071,"Amazing, I always get excited to see a new video from you guys. I don't know it's just so calming and one of those faith in humanity restored things to see somebody find happiness. Kiddo is cute as heck, mine turned 6 in september and it's just crazy to think of all the time passed. Also talk about a flash from the past, I remember Ib as well! I can't remember who I saw play it first but I imagine I watched yours too. I know I played it as well back in the day, I really need to see about getting it on steam and do it for the channel as when I played it was before I did channel stuff and maybe my memory will be nice and I forgot all the twists and turns. Another great one from back then was Witch's House which they also released on steam as well. So many new turns in that one."
6072,6072,bjorn learning english swedish italian japanese
6073,6073,Me in the corner: He doesn't know that Ib isn't an obscure game anymore and that it had a remaster

6152,6152,"Long time pewdiepie watcher from 2012, I can’t believe I watch this man move in with his girlfriend, adopt 2 dogs, go on tours, move cross country, get married and now is a father. When he was in his early 20s, I was a preteen day dreaming to be his age to experience my 20s, now that I am in my 20s and he’s in his 30s, it’s the same cycle all over again. It’s such a beautiful feeling looking up to the both of them 🥲 congratulations Marzia & Felix. 🤍 you guys will be amazing parents to Bjorn"

6343,6343,Japan arc is really good ❤
6344,6344,My oldest is 3 1/2. The infant stage so far is my least favorite. A lot of people look at my funny when I say that but it is so fun to see their personality and see them start to learn and discover. Infants are sweet but they are too needy and boring. lol
6345,6345,I can't let pewds retire so I will watch his video every day
6346,6346,I can’t wait to see the interaction between Pweds and Bjorn in 3 years from now.

6354,6354,a young japanese viking!!!!
6355,6355,"Although Pewds is fully aware, THIS is what life looks like."
6356,6356,I have a question Would you allow your kids to have tattoos?
6357,6357,You are best gamer dad pewds

His reading proficiency is especially impressive."
6520,6520,❤
6521,6521,do you and marzia speak fluent japanese rn?
6522,6522,I spend my whole life trying to get where pewd’s is while Pewd’s is spending his life just trying to be normal.
6523,6523,"I'm curious if they are talking english, swedish, italian or japanese around him? That's gonna be a confused baby."
6524,6524,"I use the Word ""bjughhuhh"" all the time"
6525,6525,"YA RABOTAYUUU

6526,6526,We all know how you got that baby
6527,6527,i know it was unintentionally but the music at 6:15 was the same as the technoblade final potato war video and it caught me so off guard and hit me right in the feels :((
6528,6528,next time you should put subtitles when the baby speaks (i don't speak baby).

6561,6561,His life has become one of those flashbacks in movies when the main character remembers his perfect life
6562,6562,Pewds in his dad era is the wholesome content the world needs.

6587,6587,"For me, every month and year got better and better. They each come with different challenges but watching your child grow into their own person is amazing."
6588,6588,Maybe Ib replay time since Felix didn't get in the Exhibit to see his thank you PewDiePie sign 😂
6589,6589,does this mean we will get a second ib letsplay…
6590,6590,"I never knew you were a father, Felix and I also have your mobile game"

6708,6708,6:23 it was the cutest Russian i've ever heard
6709,6709,"I would consider pixelating your child's face as they grow older. These vlogs are wonderful, but children also have a right to privacy, especially since they cannot consent yet to having their face shown to such a large audience. One can never know how they will feel about their baby videos being seen by so many people. That can have an effect on their psyche."
6710,6710,Ma boi living his best life

I went from a 13 year old hater of your screaming reactions to instantly getting hooked on the Happy Wheels series and becoming a more grounded person, the bridge was wild for me (as a black fan) but it is what it is (I'd like to believe he doesn't dislike me by default). Now he's married and is a loving father to a healthy kid and its beautiful to see development."
