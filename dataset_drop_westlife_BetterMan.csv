98,98,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

417,417,"I used to have an evolutionary biology, how we run a 200 people class + a 50 station on tape worms or the dead animal parts on a dissection lab, meaning its about half min per station ""keep walking"" or else to filling a greek name on those tape worm open. He fainted. Its on the Korean Drama (The Day You Found Out), one of those Sondia, ""First Love"" in the sweet heart 17 or one of those college dorm things. We met on the road. I hardly remember what he looks like. He looks like JC Chasez not the curls hair, when you cutting short, it looks the same like every other guys? You know, sometimes to the girl for saying sometimes looks probably like that. We used to be in the clubs that using the same stair. Going up or down. He is in the LGBT. I met many other guys in the evolutionary biology, so that time I didn't remember all that much of him. Like Silas with his friends behind several row from me and Andrew. That gives you a pictures its all the guys around, if not just in the Honor class there were Dean or Wing or Bill or Patrick at. So often....he disappeared. Seth."

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

516,516,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth

819,819,"Lyrics
You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

960,960,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

For me, Westlife songs must be like this song with ""Vocal Based"" style, rather than heavy rock song style.. 

Love it.

Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

1176,1176,"Remind me of a breakup.. We were in a relationship for 2 years. Covid started as well, and we didn't see each other outside of High School. From there things just went downhill so she decided it was best to end things. I'm sure it's normal to reminisce about the past and the good memories, just trying to heal :) I used to listen to this song back then; it's crazy how a certain music can take you back to places."

1269,1269,2022 and still listening while drinking my morning coffee.
1270,1270,This layering of chorus is super irritating me. Why are they not letting Shane sing his chorus and let Mark sing his? It's  so irritating especially when I want to hear Shane. Its no secret I'm a huge fan of Shane's  tone. To layer it takes away the sweetness of his tone. So irritating. They did it even in Wild Dreams. I don't know why🤷‍♀️. Seriously irritating.
1271,1271,❤❤❤❤❤

1384,1384,Their voice never change. And their new album was really spectacular.
1385,1385,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

1564,1564,"BETTER MAN
You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby, oh why
Now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

1954,1954,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

2114,2114,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you…"

Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?

2590,2590,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

2640,2640,"Everybody taking about these boybands. The boyband that started it all was the best and no other band in my opinion can comare to the Jackson 5 and the Osmonds. The Osmond brothers sung another kind of music. The Jackson 5 was the best pop group out here. They started it all, everyone else just followed. I love westlife, N'sync, boyz 2 men, the temptations, four tops, debarge, switch it was so many good boyband or young  bands that do not recieve credit! Most of the ones I named are legendary! All of these boybands bands that came along years or even decades later from these, have these to be thankful to. Kpop is okay, but they can not compare to these I named. These bands stood flat footed open up their mouths and did sing. They did not have all this studio help that these bands have today to make them look good, they were good because they had to just sing."
2641,2641,NOOOOO I'M CRYING
2642,2642,A better man ❤️♥️👍😊🙂

2673,2673,"Better man

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

2839,2839,"BETTER MAN
You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

I’m so happy you guys came back together and continued, not tried to be like every other group out there today singing the same kind of music. You’re doing it your way and it’s a good way, a reputable way. I’ll never grow tired of you."

3010,3010,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

Westlife Lyrics

Track ""Westlife""

on Bandsintown

""Better Man""

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

3146,3146,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

3461,3461,Been listening to westlife since I was young. Now I'm 22 and I feel like these men spoiled me too much. Their songs are just.. I don't know how to describe it. The lyrics are just everything. I'm just curious  but what make you guys listen to westlife? Anyone would like to share? Or anyone can finish my hanging sentences about their songs?

I was so addicted i listened to all the songs, my fav member was Mark Feehily, to the point i had never sketched so good my whole life, but bcus i love him that much, I was able to and it was great, now idk where it was. I made fanfictions of Westlife in Wattpad, only one of it was finished, since i started growing up and doing grown up things. Now I'm 17 and trying to come back to writing again that's why I'm right here coming back to them again to find my motivation I once lost. I really love Westlife and I'm be writing more fanfictions abt them. Let's keep supporting them guys! Xo"

3713,3713,"Lyrics:
You and I had something special, baby

Something that you only see on movie screens, I know

Lately, I've been missing you like crazy

Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low

But I don't think that that's the way to go

Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own

Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?

After giving it all, you gave it up

Maybe my love wasn't enough

You think you know, but you never can

How do you lose your only plan?

Well darling, just give me one more chance

And I'll give you everything I have

I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked

I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know

Everyone's got that special baby

Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low

But I don't think that that's the way to go

Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own

Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?

After giving it all, you gave it up

Maybe my love wasn't enough

You think you know, but you never can

How do you lose your only plan?

Well darling, just give me one more chance

And I'll give you everything I have

I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down

Think that's just what love's about

You took the words right out my mouth

If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while but I've figured it out

But it ain't just what love's about?

You took the words right out my mouth

But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)

After giving it all, you gave it up

And maybe my love wasn't enough

You think you know, but you never can

And how do you lose your only plan?

Well darling, just give me one more chance

And I'll give you everything I have

I'll try to be a better man"

3763,3763,"In my opinion the only good song from the album. 😐  It sounds like the old Westlife songs. The sound of the other songs is exactly like the other modern music. Ed sheeran can't produce and write music in the style and quality of the old songs. It sounds modern and there is no more individuality. What I like about the late 90th pop is, that there is still an acoustic guitar, a piano and a drum set in it. And this is exactly what I miss in the new music. ☹️"

3883,3883,"Better Man Westlife 

You and I had something special, baby
(Kau dan aku punya sesuatu yang spesial, sayang)
Something that you only see on movie screens
(Sesuatu yang hanya kamu lihat di film)
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
(Aku tahu akhir-akhir ini aku sangat merindukanmu)
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?
(Oh kenapa, kenapa kamu membiarkanku masuk hanya untuk membiarkanku pergi?)

Most guys will get high when feeling low
(Sebagian besar pria akan menjadi tinggi saat merasa rendah)
But I don't think that that's the way to go
(Tapi aku tidak berpikir itu adalah jalan yang dilalui)
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
(Beberapa kali, aku akan duduk sendiri)
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
(Berpikir tentang hidup, tentang kau dan aku)

How do you lose the one you love?
(Bagaimana kamu kehilangan orang yang kamu cinta?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
(Setelah kamu memberikan semuanya, kamu menyerah)
And maybe my love wasn't enough
(Dan mungin cintaku tidak cukup)
You think you know, but you never can
(Kamu pikir kamu tahu, tapi kamu tidak akan pernah bisa)
How do you lose your only plan?
(Bagaimana kamu kehilangan satu-satunya rencanamu?)
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
(Oh sayang, berikan aku satu kesempatan lagi)
And I'll give you everything I have
(Dan aku akan memberikanmu segala sesuatu yang kupunya)
I'll try to be a better man
(Aku akan mencoba menjadi pria yang lebih baik)

I felt things when we were naked
(Aku merasakan banyak hal ketika kita telanjang)
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
(Aku melihat malaikat tapi mereka menyembunyikan sayapnya)
I know everyone's got that special baby
(Aku tahu setiap orang punya keistimewaan itu sayang)
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams
(Oh kenapa sekarang aku hanya melihatmu dalam mimpiku)

Most guys will get high when feeling low
(Sebagian besar pria akan menjadi tinggi saat merasa rendah)
But I don't think that that's the way to go
(Tapi aku tidak berpikir itu adalah jalan yang dilalui)
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
(Beberapa kali, aku akan duduk sendiri)
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
(Berpikir tentang hidup, tentang kau dan aku)

How do you lose the one you love?
(Bagaimana kamu kehilangan orang yang kamu cinta?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
(Setelah kamu memberikan semuanya, kamu menyerah)
And maybe my love wasn't enough
(Dan mungin cintaku tidak cukup)
You think you know, but you never can
(Kamu pikir kamu tahu, tapi kamu tidak akan pernah bisa)
How do you lose your only plan?
(Bagaimana kamu kehilangan satu-satunya rencanamu?)
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
(Oh sayang, berikan aku satu kesempatan lagi)
And I'll give you everything I have
(Dan aku akan memberikanmu segala sesuatu yang kupunya)
I'll try to be a better man
(Aku akan mencoba menjadi pria yang lebih baik)

I've been up and I've been down
(Aku sudah bangkit dan jatuh)
Ain't that just what love's about?
(Bukankah itu hanya tentang cinta?) 
You took the words right out my mouth
(Kamu mengeluarkan kata-kata dari mulutku)
If you feel it, say it now
(Jika kamu merasakannya, katakan sekarang)

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
(Sudah lama tapi telah kutemukan jawabannya)
But ain't that just what love's about?
(Tapi bukankah itu hanya tentang cinta?)
You took the words right out my mouth
(Kamu mengeluarkan kata-kata dari mulutku)
But if you feel it, say it now
(Jika kamu merasakannya, katakanlah sekarang)

How do you lose the one you love?
(Bagaimana kamu kehilangan orang yang kamu cinta?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
(Setelah kamu memberikan semuanya, kamu menyerah)
And maybe my love wasn't enough
(Dan mungin cintaku tidak cukup)
You think you know, but you never can
(Kamu pikir kamu tahu, tapi kamu tidak akan pernah bisa)
How do you lose your only plan?
(Bagaimana kamu kehilangan satu-satunya rencanamu?)
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
(Oh sayang, berikan aku satu kesempatan lagi)
And I'll give you everything I have
(Dan aku akan memberikanmu segala sesuatu yang kupunya)
I'll try to be a better man
(Aku akan mencoba menjadi pria yang lebih baik)"

언제봐두 언제들어두  목소리가  아니음색이
맑은소리
언제 보아두  한결같은모습들에
감사하고감사하며
그들을 바라보고 듣고 보고 있습니다
늘 평안하고 경쾌하며맑고 청아한 모습들이
이어지길  늘 기도하겠습니다
여러분 건강하시구
아름다운곡들 높은하늘처럼 깊은
바다처럼 많이 들려주시길 바랄게요"

4133,4133,"Lyrics:
You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

4408,4408,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance

4508,4508,I don't see my childhood crush Brian McFadden.i miss him so much
4509,4509,"""Better Man""

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

4954,4954,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

5013,5013,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

5450,5450,"so emotional , i felt every word they sing .... Amazing as usual ... my love for shane filan"
5451,5451,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

5583,5583,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go

You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)

Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

You have been my motivation to start learning English, b'cse i liked your vocal without knowing the meaning of the song. my sister who was older than me had a book reserved for Westlife songs, she wrote down with a pen some of your lyrics and i used to beg her for borrowing the book to me for few minutes.  May be I am not fluent now, However what i knew so far is thanks to you.  THANK U for being my biggest motivation. LOVE from RWANDA."

6629,6629,"Better Man (Lyrics) 

Westlife

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But it ain't just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

7002,7002,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

7216,7216,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why’d you let me in just to let me go?

[Pre-Chorus]
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I’ll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

[Verse 2]
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don’t think that that’s the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking ’bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I’ll try to be a better man

[Bridge]
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love? (How do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

7393,7393,'I'm 13 Years old but i'm a huge fan of westlife.
7394,7394,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel but they've hidden their wings
I know, everyone's got that special baby
Oh, why, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

7642,7642,"""How do you lose the one you love"" ? 😔"
7643,7643,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?


Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me


How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man


I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel but they've hidden their wings
I know, everyone's got that special baby
Oh, why, now I only see you in my dreams


Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me


How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man


I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now


It's been a while but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now


How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man.....

7803,7803,"Yo u and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel but they've hidden their wings
I know, everyone's got that special baby
Oh, why, now I only see you in my dreams
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man
I've been up and I've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now
How do you lose the one you love? (how do you lose?)
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
And how do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

Then all the way back to queen, aerosmith, tony braxton and other legends. It's amazing how music evolved to what it is now. Feels like how britney spears came out with ' from the bottom of my broken heart' and now releasing songs like 'Work Bi*ch' XD still, there is still great songs that out from my generation"

10088,10088,"Westlife - Better Man
[with translate Bahasa]


[Verse 1]
You and I had something special, baby
Kau dan aku miliki sesuatu yang istimewa, sayang
Something that you only see on movie screen
Sesuatu yang hanya kau lihat di layar film
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Aku tahu belakangan ini aku sangat merindukanmu
Oh, why, why'd you let me in just to let me go?
Oh, kenapa, kenapa kau membiarkan aku masuk hanya untuk membiarkan aku pergi?

[Pre-Chorus]
Most guys will get high when feeling low
Kebanyakan pria akan menjadi tinggi saat merasa rendah
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Namun aku tak memikirkan jalannya
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Terkadang aku akan duduk sendiri
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
Memikirkan tentang hidup, memikirkan tentang kau dan aku

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love?
Bagaimana kalau kau kehilangan orang yang kau cintai?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Setelah memberikan semuanya
Maybe my love wasn't enough
Mungkin cintaku tak cukup
You think you know, but you never can
Kau pikir kau tahu, tapi kau tak pernah bisa
How do you lose your only plan?
Bagaimana kalau kau kehilangan satu-satunya rencanamu?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
Ya sayang, beri aku satu kesempatan lagi
And I'll give you everything I have
Dan akan kuserahkan semua yang kumiliki
I'll try to be a better man
Aku akan berusaha menjadi pria yang lebih baik

[Verse 2]
I felt things when we were naked
Aku merasakan sesuatu saat kita telanjang
I saw an angel but they've hidden their wings
Kulihat seorang malaikat tapi menyembunyikan sayapnya
I know, everyone's got that special baby
Aku tahu, setiap orang punya keistimewaan itu sayang
Oh, why, now I only see you in my dreams
Oh, kenapa, sekarang aku hanya melihatmu dalam mimpiku

[Pre-Chorus]
Most guys will get high when feeling low
Kebanyakan pria akan menjadi tinggi saat merasa rendah
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Namun aku tak memikirkan jalannya
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Terkadang aku akan duduk sendiri
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me
Memikirkan tentang hidup, memikirkan tentang kau dan aku

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love?
Bagaimana kalau kau kehilangan orang yang kau cintai?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Setelah memberikan semuanya
Maybe my love wasn't enough
Mungkin cintaku tak cukup
You think you know, but you never can
Kau pikir kau tahu, tapi kau tak pernah bisa
How do you lose your only plan?
Bagaimana kalau kau kehilangan satu-satunya rencanamu?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
Ya sayang, beri aku satu kesempatan lagi
And I'll give you everything I have
Dan akan kuserahkan semua yang kumiliki
I'll try to be a better man
Aku akan berusaha menjadi pria yang lebih baik

[Bridge]
I've been up and I've been down
Aku sudah jatuh dan bangkit
Think that's just what love's about
Memikirkan tentang cinta
You took the words right out my mouth
Kau mengeluarkan kata-kata itu dari mulutku
If you feel it, say it now
Jika kau merasakannya, katakanlah sekarang
It's been a while but I've figured it out
Sudah lama namun telah kutemukan jawabannya
But ain't that just what love's about?
Tapi bukankah itu tentang cinta?
You took the words right out my mouth
Kau mengeluarkan kata-kata itu dari mulutku
But if you feel it, say it now
Tapi jika kau merasakannya, katakanlah sekarang

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love? (How do you lose?)
Bagaimana kalau kau kehilangan orang yang kau cintai?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Setelah memberikan semuanya
Maybe my love wasn't enough
Mungkin cintaku tak cukup
You think you know, but you never can
Kau pikir kau tahu, tapi kau tak pernah bisa
How do you lose your only plan?
Bagaimana kalau kau kehilangan satu-satunya rencanamu?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
Ya sayang, beri aku satu kesempatan lagi
And I'll give you everything I have
Dan akan kuserahkan semua yang kumiliki
I'll try to be a better man
Aku akan berusaha menjadi pria yang lebih baik

My love for their songs never dies throughout the years and I was delighted to see Shane released his solos (my bias, of course). I am 25 now and I couldn't express how happy I am when they're reunited and listening to their songs reminded me of their old songs. Old but gold."

11528,11528,"[Verse 1]
You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens, I know
Lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh, why, why’d you let me in just to let me go?

[Pre - Chorus]
Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I’ll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

[Chorus]
How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

[Verse 2]
I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings, I know
Everyone's got that special baby
Oh, I, now I only see you in my dreams"

12039,12039,"This is exactly what I imagined a modern Westlife song to sound like.^_^. The verses are fit in with today's pop and the chorus harmonies are pure Westlife!!!! My only complaint is that the key change could have been bigger, more dramatic, and consequently a bit more nostalgic. I miss the big ballads of the 90's, back when Celine, Mariah, Whitney (RIP), and others were dominating the radio."

She's 34 and I'm 25.

But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

14412,14412,"This is why Dancing on Ice star Brian McFadden won't be re-joining Westlife
He won't be flying without wings anytime soon.
Westlife fans have been waiting many a season in the sun to see the boyband back together with Brian McFadden… and it sounds like they'll be waiting for the rest of their lives.
Nicky Byrne, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily and Shane Filan announced back in October that they'd be getting back together to release new single 'Hello My Love' and tour — but, as usual, Brian was missing.
Despite the fact that he left the group after Westlife's fourth album, fans have long wanted to see the classic line-up back on stage together. But in a new interview with Metro, the band insisted that they've totally moved on from their time with Brian.
""He left the band 15 years ago, we were only five years in and kids at the time,"" Shane insisted. ""We went on to become a band for another eight or nine years after that.
""It would be very weird to have another person in the band again, some of us haven’t seen Brian in a very long time. We haven’t fallen out with Brian either. It’s like we all went to a different school and he went another way.
""Brian left a long time ago so we’re moving forward not backwards.""
Westlife won't rule out a potential ""duet"" with Brian on a song in the future, but they seem fairly set that the days of him actually being a proper member having come and gone.
""The simple fact is Westlife is four people,"" Mark said. ""That’s the way it is and it’s not changing. It’s far too late in the day to change it.
""We love our past and story being colourful and exciting but it hasn’t been a walk in the park to get it where we are today. Brian left a long time ago so we’re moving forward not backwards.""
For his part, Brian — who previously complained about his bandmates rejecting a ""big multi-million pound deal"" to perform with him — has actually praised Westlife's new comeback single 'Hello My Love'.
""Love it! Great song great production,"" he tweeted. ""The boys are back!""
Of course, Brian is fairly busy these days in round-the-clock training sessions for Dancing on Ice, which continues this Sunday (January 13) on ITV."
14413,14413,"WESTLIFE is always the best band and the best songs to listen, this song is perfect, love it."
14414,14414,"I am just wondering, who is the young guy on the mv? He's so cuteeee! 💕"
14415,14415,"Linda,Linda.... música!

I never hate bryan, i never like his too, i just hate his concept music, always singing westlife songs... 
And i dont care when his stopped from westlife, but why? Why he doesnt promote his songs... Why singing westlife songs... Why... 

Please dont ask bryan again bout westlife, dont ask westlife again with question of bryan, they have choose different way. Please bryan consistance your choice, just forget about westlife songs. 

This is my westlife, four man, only four, forever."

Bryan continue his music with old songs of westlife and with boyzlife.  

But of course, all the songs of westlife never looks good without shane and mark voice. Excuse me, it doesnt mean that nicky and kian bad voice. Both of them have good voice. But we know, that shane and mark voice is too good on songs of westlife. .

14618,14618,After a long long time
14619,14619,"For Lyrics Better man
You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man.

14717,14717,"'BETTER MAN'

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately, I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

14949,14949,90S COMING BACK YO
14950,14950,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

‭‭Ask for forgiveness of your sins(any sins) and become a child of God.Only Christ can take away our pain.We are all broken and lost but He has shown us the Way.Enjoy the true peace and joy that God will give you.True peace and joy comes only through Jesus.Any other way is vain.Trust in the Lord then you will not fear death and it will have no power over you.God bless.❤️🙏"

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have

15117,15117,This song took me back to my younger years... When the only music I know is Westlife.
15118,15118,"Marami mang taon ang lumipas bago muling magbalik ang westlife, hindi nito nabago at naalis ang pagkahilig ng maraming tao sa kanilang musika. Ang totoo nito, marami ang natuwa at nagbunyi sa kanilang pagbabalik musika. (Although many years have passed before these band back  again to perform their new music, it doesnt changed the fact that many people and listeners still love them and their music. Infact, many people celebrates their came back. Yet as of now, many bands came and came from different world and ethnic, but WESTLIFE always remain no. 1 for me here in the Philippines and in different parts of world)."

15189,15189,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?

And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

Something that you only see on movie screen
I know lately i've been missing you like crazy
Oh,why,why'd you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling now
But i don't think that 
that's the way to go
Sometimes i'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life,thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love
After giving it all, you gave it up
Maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know,but you never can
How do you lose your only plan
Well darling, just give me one more chance
And i'll give you everything i have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked 
I saw an angel but they've hidden their wings
I know,everyone's got the special baby
Oh,why, now i only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But i don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes i'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

I've been up and i've been down
Think that's just what love's about
You yook the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now
It's been a while but i've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now"

I think they should have Bryan in there though! I’m sure any actual Westlife fan would agree with me"

16068,16068,MANTAP E
16069,16069,"This is one of the best songs I have heard in recent time...❤ The rythm reminded me of that early Westlife days...😍 The harmony of all 4 men is absolutely brilliant like always...💙 Lyrics are top notch...💚 Music was good...💛 Kian and Nicky getting chances to sing solo lines impressed me once again...💜 'Westlife' can easily go on to become the greatest boyband from here if US radio supports them and allows them to enter the market. They can rip all the current singers easily with their ultra high quality vocals...😊 But no matter if they enter the US market or not, for me they have always been the greatest and will always be...💕 #BetterMan #Westlife ❤"

16273,16273,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

16342,16342,Back in 2012 when Westlife announced their separation my heart was shattered. After so many years and now they are back! I can't be more excited than this. Better Man is another masterpiece and listening to this brings me back to 20 years ago when I first listened to their songs and felt like they have not changed at all. #WestlifeForLife

16461,16461,"Lyrics

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"
16462,16462,"Always and always Westlife...
Thank u , your song made my childhood, its very wonderful for me.."

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go

And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance

16737,16737,"Can't believe it has been 20 years.  I still rememer the day， some time in 1999, I walked into the small  CD/ tape shop around the corner near my middle school. Then I noticed a new boyband poster . There was your debut album, WESTLIFE. hah, Shane looked dumb, Mark kinda weired, Kian too serious, Nicky girlish and Bryan babyfat. I thought you were another poor copycat of BSB... But, anyway I bought your cassette for its cheap price(yeah in China everything was cheap then). On that definitive evening when I was doing my assignment, I started playing  your music... The definition of my adolescence BEGAN officially. Amazing how globalnization can impact on a little boy grown up in a small city in southwestern China."

17032,17032,"My Sentiments on Better Man

It does not speak about being a man in his place but I think it speaks about equality an in overly racial world.  

It shows that love doesn't speak of race but it does for respect and everything that this world need to see.

This song tells us to not only do better in our lives but to do better in helping others with what they are encountering today, to understand through and through what they are feeling and to let them feel that they are loved and to let them know how important their existence in this world."

17110,17110,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

Something that you only see on movie screen

You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Well darling, just give me one more chance

17329,17329,what a amazing song
17330,17330,"You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low

Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?

And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go

17734,17734,"""Better Man""

You and I had something special, baby
Something that you only see on movie screens
I know lately I've been missing you like crazy
Oh why, why d'you let me in just to let me go?

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I felt things when we were naked
I saw an angel, but they've hidden their wings
I know everyone's got that special baby
Oh I, now I only see you in my dreams

Most guys will get high when feeling low
But I don't think that that's the way to go
Sometimes I'll be sitting on my own
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout you and me

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man

I've been up and I've been down
Ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
If you feel it, say it now

It's been a while, but I've figured it out
But ain't that just what love's about?
You took the words right out my mouth
But if you feel it, say it now

How do you lose the one you love?
After giving it all, you gave it up
And maybe my love wasn't enough
You think you know, but you never can
How do you lose your only plan?
Oh darling, just give me one more chance
And I'll give you everything I have
I'll try to be a better man"
17735,17735,This is so ed's vibe😀😀but i like it
